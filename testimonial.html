      I am Navneet Jindal (VA Roll No.: 15805), have secured AIR-60 in JEE Advanced 2019. I am feeling extremely happy after achieving this feet. I was little disappointed after the JEE exam,
       but when i received the result i was very happy because my aim was to get under AIR-100 in JEE Exam. 
      I chosen Vibrant Academy because my elder brother also studied from Vibrant 2 years ago, he has learnt so many things from Vibrant. Currently he is doing electrical from IIT-BHU.
    My Aim is to go to IIT-Delhi. I want to give credit of my success to my parents, who motivated me every time whenever i felt down. HODs of Vibrant played a crucial role in this, specially VG Sir.
     His teaching methods are interesting because he made subject like maths so interesting .
     At Vibrant Academy i Gained my lost confidence back because before 11th i wasn’t confident enough to get Even under-1000 AIR. After joining Vibrant i recognized my potential and HODs here lift it higher.
    According to me 2 things are most important to crack JEE. 1st of them is consistency and will power. Will power to never give up. Because it is something that motivates you even when something is not going in your way.
      In the end i would like to thank Vibrant Directors & faculty for my success in JEE.</div>

    Hello, I am Sajal Mittal (VA Roll No.: 14763), have secured AIR - 68 in IIT-JEE 2019 and have been a regular two year classroom student of Vibrant Academy, Kota. 
      Before joining Vibrant, i never thought that i could achieve even under AIR-1000 because i was just an average student as i don't have any academic achievements. 
      But when i see the atmosphere here with full of energy & motivation i attended classes even in fever because of the positive energy provided by vibrant teaching 
      methodology and cheerful environment.My first class by PJ Sir the best class i ever had where he motivated us and that interaction with him made me to achieve under AIR-100. 
      All HODs and faculties teach really well. NKS Sir’s simplicity & dedication towards students while clearing all the concepts of physics, made physics so easy. 
      MSC Sir & Sodium Sir motivated me with their tips towards health & running to stay us healthy. VKJ Sir’s smiling face while teaching make inorganic chemistry a joy. 
      Ninja Sir’s motivation session changed my attitude because he told us to not to do good only for IIT but to do great work for life also. That help us to overcome our fears and it made my journey a glorious part of my life.
       All concepts were cleared by HODs and faculty members very well that there was nothing to worry about before going for IIT Exam.</div>
